# ☁️ Nimbus  
### _The Forecast of You_

Nimbus is a modern, cross-platform wellness and productivity app built with **Expo** and **React Native**.  
It helps users visualize their personal “forecast” — moods, habits, routines, and reminders — in an elegant, ADHD-friendly dashboard that’s designed to be both **visually engaging** and **mentally uncluttered**.

## ✨ Features (in development)
- 📅 **Routine Tracking** – Build and visualize daily/weekly routines with smooth animations  
- 💭 **Mood Forecasting** – Log emotional “weather” to spot patterns over time  
- 📋 **Reminders & Notes** – Quick, glanceable sticky reminders (“Take out the trash,” “Feed the dog,” etc.)  
- 🧠 **Offline-First Design** – Uses local secure storage; no sign-ups or cloud sync required  
- 🎨 **Dynamic UI** – Theme inspired by clouds, sunlight, and shifting skies — calm, minimal, reactive
